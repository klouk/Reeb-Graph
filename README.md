# Reeb Graph
1: Compute the dual graph of a Model_3D.

2: Create the protrusion map using the dual graph and geodetic distances.

3: Calculate extreme points from protrusion function.

4: For each extreme point the Reeb Graph is calculated, using the geodesic distance as distance. Also, the classing graph per height is calculated

5: Motion transformation is applied in 3d models

6: 3D model segmentation using the Reeb graph

7: 3D model simplification

# Dependencies

VVRFRAMEWORK

# Future Steps
Code refactoring
Use pcl instead of VVRFRAMEWORK
